        ### Created a CNN model that can classify images of the three major attacking diseases of Rice plants they are Bacterial blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut.

        ### 1.Bacterial Blight
                
        - It is a deadly bacterial disease that is among the most destructive afflictions of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima). 
        The disease was first observed in 1884-85 in Kyushu, Japan, and the causal agent, the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae (also referred to as Xoo), was identified in 1911,
        at that time having been named Bacillus oryzae. Thriving in warm, humid environments, bacterial blight has been observed in rice-growing regions of Asia, 
        the western coast of Africa, Australia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

        - Bacterial blight first becomes evident as water-soaked streaks that spread from the leaf tips and margins, becoming larger and eventually releasing a milky ooze that dries into yellow droplets.
        Characteristic grayish white lesions then appear on the leaves, signaling the late stages of infection, when leaves dry out and die. In seedlings, the leaves dry out and wilt, a syndrome known as kresek.
        Infected seedlings usually are killed by bacterial blight within two to three weeks of being infected; adult plants may survive, though rice yield and quality are diminished.

        - Since rice paddies are flooded throughout most of the growing season, Xoo may easily spread among crops, bacteria travel through the water from infected plants to the roots and leaves of neighboring rice plants.
        Wind and water may also help spread Xoo bacteria to other crops and rice paddies. Various mechanisms of disease, including quorum sensing and biofilm formation, have been observed in rice bacterial blight and Xoo. 
        In addition to rice, Xoo may infect other plants, such as rice cut-grass (Leersia oryzoides), Chinese sprangletop (Leptochloa chinensis), and common grasses and weeds. 
        In nongrowing seasons, Xoo may survive in rice seeds, straw, other living hosts, water, or, for brief periods, soil.

        ### 2.Brown Spot
                
        - The brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases.

        - It is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets. Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. 
        When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.

        - The disease can develop in areas with high relative humidity (86-100%) and temperature between 16 and 36¬∞C. It is common in unflooded and nutrient-deficient soil, or in soils that accumulate toxic substances.
        For infection to occur, the leaves must be wet for 8-24 hours.
        The fungus can survive in the seed for more than four years and can spread from plant to plant through air. Major sources of brown spots in the field include

        - Brown spots can occur at all crop stages, but the infection is most critical during maximum tillering up to the ripening stages of the crop. It also causes both quantity and quality losses.
        On average, the disease causes a 5% yield loss across all lowland rice production in South and Southeast Asia. Severely infected fields can have as high as 45% yield loss.
        Heavily infected seeds cause seedling blight and lead to (10-58%) seedling mortality. It also affects the quality and the number of grains per panicle and reduces the kernel weight.
        In terms of history, the Brown Spot was considered to be the major factor contributing to the Great Bengal Famine of 1943.

        ### 3.Leaf blast
                
        - Leaf blast in rice, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (also known as Pyricularia oryzae), is one of the most destructive diseases affecting rice crops globally.
        It primarily targets the leaves but can also spread to other aerial parts of the plant, including the collar, nodes, neck, and panicles.
        Initial symptoms appear as white to gray-green lesions with dark brown borders, which later develop into spindle-shaped or diamond-shaped spots. 
        
        - These lesions can enlarge and coalesce, leading to complete leaf death, especially in young seedlings and during the tillering stage. Severe infections reduce the leaf area available for photosynthesis, ultimately lowering grain yield.
        The disease thrives under cool daytime temperatures, frequent rain showers, high humidity, and low soil moisture‚Äîconditions common in upland rice fields. Dew formation due to large day-night temperature differences also promotes fungal growth. 
        The fungus spreads via airborne spores and can survive on infected plant debris, straw, and seeds.

        ### 4.Tungro Disease
                
        - Tungro is a viral disease complex in rice caused by two viruses: Rice Tungro Bacilliform Virus (RTBV) and Rice Tungro Spherical Virus (RTSV). 
        It is transmitted primarily by the green leafhopper (Nephotettix virescens), which acquires the virus by feeding on infected plants and spreads it to healthy ones.
                
        - The disease affects all growth stages of rice but is most severe during the vegetative and tillering stages. Infected plants exhibit stunted growth, reduced tillering, and delayed flowering. Leaves show yellow to orange discoloration, starting from the tip and progressing downward. 
        Rust-colored spots and mottling may appear, and panicles may be small, sterile, or poorly filled.
        
        ### Overall Analysis
                
        - Each disease has distinct symptoms and impacts on rice plants, affecting their growth, photosynthesis, and overall yield. 
        Effective disease management strategies include using disease-resistant rice varieties, implementing proper field hygiene practices, and avoiding conditions that promote disease spread. 
        
        - Early detection and prompt intervention are crucial to minimizing the economic and agronomic losses caused by these diseases.
        The classification model developed in this project will contribute to early disease detection and timely management, helping to ensure healthier rice crops and higher yields. 
        Remember that accurate disease diagnosis requires the expertise of plant pathologists. This analysis serves as a general overview, and specific diagnosis should involve consultation with experts in the field. """)
