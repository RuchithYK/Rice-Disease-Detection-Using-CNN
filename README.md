This project uses **Deep Learning (CNN)** to detect diseases in rice leaves from uploaded images.  
It helps farmers identify diseases early and take preventive measures to improve crop yield.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Goal:** Automatically detect rice leaf diseases using image recognition  
- **Frontend & Deployment:** Streamlit, Hugging Face Spaces  
- **Backend & ML:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Dataset:** Rice leaf images (Healthy + Diseased)  
- **Output:** Predicted disease name with confidence percentage
